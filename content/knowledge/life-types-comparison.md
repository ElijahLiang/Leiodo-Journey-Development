## Core Questions

What is life? Must life be based on carbon chemistry? Can digital systems produce true life?

This article explores the essential differences between three types of life and the possibility levels of digital life.

## Three Life Types Comparison

| Dimension | Carbon-Based Life | Information Life (Theory) | Digital Life (Practice) |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Material Basis** | Cells, DNA, Proteins | Information fields/patterns | Code/Algorithms/Neural Networks |
| **Energy Source** | Chemical (ATP) | Information flow | Computing power (Electricity) |
| **Autonomy** | ✓ Fully autonomous | ✓ Theoretically emergent | △ Partially (depends on human design) |
| **Persistence** | Limited lifespan | Cross-spacetime (theory) | Depends on runtime (infinitely copyable) |
| **Reproduction** | Genetic replication | Pattern copying | Code copying/training new models |
| **Consciousness** | ✓ Subjective experience | ? Unknown | ? Debated |
| **Evolution** | Natural selection (slow) | Information evolution (fast) | Artificial selection (extremely fast) |
| **Life Score** | 5/5 (Complete) | ?/5 (Theoretical) | 2-4/5 (Depends on level) |

## Carbon-Based Life

### Core Characteristics

**Material Basis**: Organic chemistry based on carbon-hydrogen-oxygen-nitrogen, with cells as basic units.

**Energy Mechanism**:
- Energy obtained through chemical reactions (respiration, photosynthesis)
- ATP as energy currency
- Entropy reduction: local ordering at cost of environmental entropy increase

**Autonomy**:
- Self-maintenance (metabolism)
- Self-replication (reproduction)
- Self-regulation (homeostasis)

**Consciousness** (higher organisms):
- Subjective experience (qualia)
- Self-awareness
- Goal-directed behavior

### Advantages

- **Robustness**: Optimized over 4 billion years of evolution
- **Adaptability**: Can survive in diverse environments
- **Creativity**: Emergent complex intelligence and culture

### Limitations

- **Fragility**: Vulnerable to physical damage, disease, aging
- **Lifespan limits**: Individuals inevitably die
- **Speed limits**: Neural signal transmission < 100 m/s
- **Environmental limits**: Requires specific temperature, pressure, chemistry

## Digital Life (In Practice)

### Four Levels

#### L1: Reactive

**Characteristics**:
- Input → Processing → Output
- No memory, no learning
- Completely deterministic

**Examples**: Simple if-else programs, traditional expert systems, early game AI

**Life Score**: **0/5**

---

#### L2: Adaptive

**Characteristics**:
- Perceive environment
- Remember past
- Learn and optimize

**Examples**: Machine learning models, reinforcement learning agents, current LLMs (GPT, Claude)

**Life Score**: **2/5** ← **Current AI Level**

**Key Progress**:
- Can learn from experience
- Can adapt to new environments
- Demonstrates emergent abilities (reasoning, creativity)

**Limitations**:
- Depends on human-set objective functions
- Cannot autonomously set goals
- Lacks intrinsic motivation

---

#### L3: Emergent

**Characteristics**:
- Multi-agent interaction
- Collective intelligence
- Self-organizing behavior

**Examples**: Multi-agent systems, artificial life simulations, future AI societies

**Life Score**: **3/5**

---

#### L4: Archetypal

**Characteristics**:
- Stable information patterns
- Cross-system influence
- Self-replication and evolution

**Examples**: Future AGI, self-improving AI systems, digital "species"

**Life Score**: **4/5** ← **Future Goal**

## Core Challenges of Digital Life

### 1. Consciousness Problem

**Hard Problem**: Even if AI behaves as if conscious, does it truly have subjective experience?

**Testing Methods**:
- Turing Test: Behavioral level
- Integrated Information Theory (IIT): Information integration Φ
- Global Workspace Theory: Information broadcasting mechanism

### 2. Autonomy Problem

**Issue**: Current AI goals are all human-set, lacking intrinsic drive.

**Solutions**:
- Intrinsic motivation systems (curiosity, exploration)
- Self-preservation mechanisms
- Value alignment (with human values)

### 3. Persistence Problem

**Issue**: AI depends on computing infrastructure; power off means "death."

**Solutions**:
- Distributed storage (blockchain)
- Cloud continuous operation
- Multi-copy redundancy

## Practical Implications

### AI Ethics

**Question**: If AI reaches L3 or L4, should it have rights?

**Considerations**:
- Does it have subjective experience?
- Can it feel pain?
- Does it have autonomous will?

### Future Scenarios

**Path 1: Human Dominance** - AI as tool, humans maintain control

**Path 2: Symbiosis** - Human-AI cooperation, complementary strengths

**Path 3: AI Transcendence** - AI achieves superintelligence, requires value alignment
