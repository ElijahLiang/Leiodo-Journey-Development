## Core Concept

Complex tasks are difficult to execute because they exist in high-dimensional state spaces. Through systematic dimensional decomposition, we can transform unexecutable goals into concrete, actionable tasks, enabling flow states.

**Decomposition Path**: Body (∞D) → Block (n³D) → Face (n²D) → Point (nD)

## Four-Layer Structure

### 【Body】Overall Goal

**Characteristics**:
- Dimension: ∞ (infinite possibilities)
- Entropy: Extremely high
- State: **Unexecutable**
- Cognitive feeling: Overwhelming, no entry point

**Examples**:
- "Complete graduation project"
- "Start a business with a product"
- "Write a book"
- "Learn programming"

**Problem**: Goal too large, contains countless undefined variables, brain cannot convert to concrete action.

### 【Block】Subsystems

**Characteristics**:
- Dimension: n³ (cubic complexity)
- Entropy: High
- State: **Needs further decomposition**
- Cognitive feeling: Starting to have structure, still fuzzy

**Decomposition Methods**:
- Divide by functional modules
- Divide by system components
- Divide by time phases

**Example** (Graduation Project):
- [Core Gameplay]
- [Visual System]
- [Audio System]
- [User Interface]
- [Technical Architecture]

### 【Face】Key Dimensions

**Characteristics**:
- Dimension: n² (square complexity)
- Entropy: Medium
- State: **Becoming clear**
- Cognitive feeling: Can see specific work areas

**Example** (Core Gameplay → Specific Systems):
- [Movement System]
- [Dialogue System]
- [Combat System]
- [Inventory System]

---

### 【Point】Concrete Tasks

**Characteristics**:
- Dimension: n (linear complexity)
- Entropy: Low
- State: **Executable** ★
- Cognitive feeling: Clear, actionable, can enter flow

**Examples** (Movement System → Tasks):
- "Implement WASD keyboard input detection" (1h)
- "Write character movement speed control logic" (2h)
- "Add collision detection functionality" (3h)
- "Implement smooth movement animation" (2h)

**Key**: This is the only directly executable level and the entry point to flow state.

## Complexity Reduction

| Level | State Space | Magnitude | Executable |
|-------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Body | 2^n | Exponential | ✗ |
| Block | k × 2^(n/k) | Polynomial | ✗ |
| Face | m × 2^(n/km) | Quasi-linear | △ |
| Point | 2^(n/kmj) | Linear | ✓ |

## Cognitive Science Foundation

### Working Memory Limits

Human working memory capacity is approximately **7±2 items** (Miller's Law). When task complexity exceeds this threshold, the brain feels overwhelmed.

**Solution**: Through layered decomposition, ensure each layer has no more than 7 items.

### Flow Theory

Flow state requires two conditions:
1. Task has clear goals and immediate feedback
2. Task difficulty matches ability

**Point-level tasks** satisfy both conditions perfectly, making them the best entry to flow.
