## Core Concept

**Block Universe Theory** (also called **Eternalism**) is a perspective in modern physics about the nature of time. It proposes that past, present, and future all exist simultaneously in a four-dimensional spacetime structure, where time is simply one of the dimensions.

## Four-Dimensional Spacetime Structure

|  +---------+                        |
|  |  Past   | Events that occurred   |

### Key Insights

**All moments exist simultaneously**: Like all pages of a book existing at once, all moments of the universe exist simultaneously in the 4D spacetime block.

**Consciousness is a 0-dimensional point**: Our consciousness can only experience "now" - like a projector's beam illuminating only one frame of film.

**Time flow is subjective**: What we perceive as "time passing" is actually consciousness moving through the 4D block, scanning frame by frame.

## Dimensional Hierarchy

| Dimension | Type | Degrees of Freedom | Experience |
|-----------|------|-------------------|------------|
| **Space** | 3D (x, y, z) | Free movement | Can move in any direction |
| **Time** | 1D (t) | One-way only | Can only move past→future |
| **Experience** | 0D (point) | None | Can only experience "now" |
| **Cognition** | 4D+ | Understanding | Can imagine higher dimensions |

## Three Views of Time

### 1. Presentism

**View**: Only the present is real; the past has vanished, the future doesn't exist yet.

**Problems**:
- Conflicts with relativity (different reference frames have different "nows")
- Cannot explain the nature of causality

### 2. Growing Block Universe

**View**: Past and present are real, future doesn't exist yet; universe is constantly "growing."

**Problems**:
- Requires defining an absolute "now"
- Not fully compatible with relativity

### 3. Block Universe ★

**View**: Past, present, and future are equally real, all existing in the 4D spacetime block.

**Advantages**:
- Fully compatible with relativity
- Explains time's symmetry
- Matches physics' mathematical descriptions

## Practical Implications

### 1. Rethinking Time Management

**Traditional**: Time is flowing, we must "catch" it.

**Block Universe**: Time doesn't flow; our consciousness moves along the time axis.

**Insight**: Focus on the present—it's the only moment consciousness can directly experience.

### 2. Alleviating Anxiety

**Traditional anxiety**: Worrying about future, regretting past.

**Block Universe perspective**:
- Past is already part of the spacetime block—cannot change, no need to regret
- Future in some sense already "exists"—we just haven't experienced it yet
- Present is the only moment where we can "choose"

### 3. Reconsidering Life's Meaning

**Traditional**: Life is brief, will eventually vanish.

**Block Universe**: Your life exists eternally in the 4D spacetime block; every moment has eternal value.

## Scientific Basis

### Einstein's Spacetime View

Einstein unified time and space into **four-dimensional spacetime** in relativity. Time is no longer an independent flow but forms a geometric structure together with space.

**Einstein's quote** (in a letter to the family of his friend Besso):
> "For us believing physicists, the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."

### Minkowski Spacetime

Mathematician Minkowski expressed relativity as 4D spacetime geometry, where time is the fourth dimension:

**Spacetime Interval**:
```
Δs² = c²Δt² - Δx² - Δy² - Δz²
```
